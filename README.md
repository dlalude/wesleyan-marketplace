   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Note: Chrome may display a security warning; for a better experience, use Safari or another browser.

### **Performance Results & Best Experience Recommendations**
We achieved **95+ scores** for both **mobile and desktop** on performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO using **Lighthouse**.

#### **Optimizing Your Experience**
- **Browser Extensions Impact Performance**: Having multiple browser extensions installed can negatively impact page load times and performance scores.
- **Recommended Viewing Mode**: For the **best and most optimal experience**, we recommend opening the site in **Incognito Mode (Private Browsing Mode)**, as this disables most extensions that could interfere with performance.
- **Supported Browsers**: While the site works well across all modern browsers, we recommend using **Google Chrome, Safari, or Firefox** for the smoothest experience.

üìù Local Database Setup Instructions

Start Apache & MySQL
Open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.
Open phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

Note: We must create the following database and tables in phpMyAdmin locally.

Database Name: app-db

SQL Queries to Create Tables:

-- Create Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Listings Table
CREATE TABLE listings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    item_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Verify Setup
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM listings;

ensure dp.php matches
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root"; // Default for XAMPP
$password = ""; // No password by default
$dbname = "app_db";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
